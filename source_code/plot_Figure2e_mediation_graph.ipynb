    "This script prepares input for Figure 2e: **Mediation analysis of the host and microbiome features for the selected drug combinations.** Drug-feature effect graph representing potential feature mediation effects between host and microbiome features. Solid lines represent drug effects on the feature, colour represents direction of the effect. Dashed lines between features indicate potential mediation (general mediation model one-sided P  < 0.1 ), colour represents the sign of Pearson’s correlation coefficient (P < 0.1). \n",
